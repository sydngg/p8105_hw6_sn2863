Starting with one city

``` r
baltimore_df <-
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD")

glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)
  ) %>%
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across different cities

``` r
model_results_df <-
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% # 3 cities do not report race and won't be included
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, 
                 ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
                     data = .x,
                     family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, results) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)
  ) %>%
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

``` r
model_results_df %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=city_state, y=OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

### Problem 2 and 3 tips

``` r
# child birthweight data for problem 2, deliberately open-ended
# use your best educated guess for the variables you decide to include your model
# you CAN do model selection, but maybe go more so for the literature...

# Two models, the first one is simple, the second with all the interactions 
# is a little more complicated...

# for the interaction term, you do not need to code for the main effect 
# -- you can JUST code for the interaction e.g. the three way interaction, 
# it will show you all the main AND the two-way interactions
# ^ check the screen cast!!

# workflow for cross-validation -- go back to the lecture maybe?
# looking at the residuals when cross-validating

# scatterplot with gestational period and birthweight
```

More about problem 3

``` r
# central park weather dataset, getting rid of Waiki and Wtaerhole
# max temp and min temp scatterplot, we are interested in the r^2

# log(beta0*beta1)
# fit a model using the data and compute the adjusted r^2 using broom::glance()
# then use broom::tidy() to get all the coefficients to be able to multiply them
# AFTER you get the process, use bootstrapping
```
